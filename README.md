# perceiver_pytorch

The transformer unit is a slight modification of the template given by Peter Bloem in his [transformer tutorial](http://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers). 
## Things to be updated
1. The model crashes when nn.DataParallel is employed
2. Although I tried to make the model as general as possible, it is still immature.
3. The model is only tested on simple text generation problems, it is not applied to any complex dataset yet. 
4. Basically is full of errors...
